      Electronegativity is a measure of the attraction a nucleus has for the shared pair of electrons in a covalent bond.
      When two nuclei that have different electronegativity values are bonded together, the bond formed is described as ‘polar covalent’.
      The bigger the difference in the electronegativity values the more polar the bond.
      The table contains electronegativity values for some atoms.
